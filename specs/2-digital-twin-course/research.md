# Research: Digital Twin Course (Gazebo & Unity)

## Decision: Course Structure and Content Organization
**Rationale**: The course will be structured around the three main topics specified: Physics Simulation with Gazebo, Environment & Interaction Design, and Sensor Simulation. Each topic will have dedicated documentation pages with hands-on exercises.

## Decision: Technology Stack
**Rationale**: Using Docusaurus as specified in the requirements provides a professional documentation site with good search, navigation, and versioning capabilities. Markdown format is ideal for technical documentation and allows for easy collaboration.

## Decision: Content Format
**Rationale**: Each chapter will include theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. The content will be structured with clear learning objectives, step-by-step instructions, and expected outcomes.

## Decision: Target Audience Considerations
**Rationale**: Content will assume basic ROS 2 knowledge as specified, focusing on advanced concepts specific to digital twins. Examples will use humanoid robots as the primary use case to maintain consistency.

## Alternatives Considered
- Video-based content: Rejected in favor of interactive documentation that allows students to follow along at their own pace
- Separate standalone application: Rejected in favor of integration with existing documentation infrastructure
- Pure theoretical content: Rejected in favor of hands-on practical exercises that reinforce learning
