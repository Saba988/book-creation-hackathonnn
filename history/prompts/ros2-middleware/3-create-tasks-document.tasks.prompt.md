# Create Tasks Document

## Prompt Text
```
Also generate tasks.md file as you did like research.md
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive tasks document for the Docusaurus implementation project. The tasks.md file breaks down the implementation into specific, actionable tasks with priorities, status, effort estimates, subtasks, and acceptance criteria. The document covers all aspects from environment setup to final validation, ensuring alignment with the feature specification and implementation plan.

## Outcome
Successfully created the tasks document at specs/1-ros2-middleware/tasks.md with detailed breakdown of all implementation tasks required for the Docusaurus documentation project.

## Evaluation
The tasks document provides a clear roadmap for implementation with well-defined tasks, priorities, and acceptance criteria that align with the project requirements and success criteria.
