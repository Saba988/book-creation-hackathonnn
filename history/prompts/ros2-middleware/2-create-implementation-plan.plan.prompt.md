# Create Implementation Plan

## Prompt Text
```
1. Install and initialize Docusaurus, configure module-based documentation, and ensure all documentation is written in `.md` files.
2. Create Module 1 with three chapters (ROS 2 Basics, rclpy AI Agents, URDF Modeling), each implemented as separate `.md` files.
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive implementation plan for Docusaurus-based documentation for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The plan includes research on Docusaurus implementation, technical context, constitution compliance check, data model for documentation entities, quickstart guide, and API contracts. All artifacts align with the project constitution and feature specification requirements.

## Outcome
Successfully created the implementation plan at specs/1-ros2-middleware/plan.md with supporting documents including research, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts.

## Evaluation
The implementation plan fully addresses the requirements for Docusaurus installation, module-based documentation structure, and creation of three chapter files as specified. The plan is constitution-compliant and technically sound.
