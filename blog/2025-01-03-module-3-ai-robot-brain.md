## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Perception Systems**: Computer vision, sensor fusion, and environment understanding
- **Motion Planning**: Path planning, trajectory generation, and obstacle avoidance
- **Control Systems**: Feedback control, humanoid locomotion, and manipulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Leveraging GPU computing for real-time AI inference

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have knowledge of ROS 2 and basic simulation concepts. If you need to review these topics, please complete Modules 1 and 2 first.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement perception systems using computer vision and sensor fusion
- Design motion planning algorithms for humanoid robots
- Create robust control systems for robot locomotion and manipulation
- Utilize NVIDIA Isaac for GPU-accelerated AI processing
- Integrate perception, planning, and control into a cohesive robot brain

## Key Concepts

### Perception Systems
Robots must understand their environment through various sensors including cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and other modalities. Perception systems process this sensor data to create meaningful representations of the world.

### Motion Planning
Motion planning algorithms generate safe and efficient paths for robots to navigate complex environments while avoiding obstacles and respecting kinematic constraints.

### Control Systems
Control systems translate high-level goals into low-level motor commands, ensuring stable and precise robot motion. For humanoid robots, this includes balance control and complex multi-joint coordination.

### NVIDIA Isaac
NVIDIA Isaac provides a comprehensive platform for developing intelligent robots, including simulation tools, perception libraries, and GPU-accelerated AI frameworks.

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on perception systems to start building your robot's intelligent brain.
