## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Understanding gravity, collisions, joints, and humanoid dynamics in simulation environments
- **Environment & Interaction Design**: World building, obstacles, and human-robot interaction concepts
- **Sensor Simulation**: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor data flow to ROS 2

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have basic knowledge of ROS 2. If you need to review ROS 2 fundamentals, please complete Module 1 first.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure physics simulations in Gazebo
- Design complex environments with obstacles and interaction points
- Implement sensor simulation with realistic outputs
- Connect virtual sensors to ROS 2 nodes for data processing

## Key Concepts

### Gazebo Physics Simulation
Gazebo provides realistic physics simulation with support for gravity, collisions, and complex joint dynamics. It's essential for testing humanoid robot behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before real-world deployment.

### Unity Integration
Unity provides advanced 3D rendering and user interface capabilities, making it ideal for creating immersive simulation environments and visualization tools for robot operation.

### Sensor Simulation
Virtual sensors in simulation must accurately reflect real-world sensor behavior, including noise, latency, and field of view limitations, to ensure that algorithms developed in simulation transfer effectively to real robots.

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on Physics Simulation with Gazebo to start your journey into digital twin technology for humanoid robotics.
