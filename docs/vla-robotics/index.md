# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Robotics

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) course for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This module focuses on translating human language into robot perception and action, specifically covering Voice-to-Action pipeline using Whisper, LLM-based cognitive planning, and the complete VLA loop in humanoid systems.

## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Voice-to-Action Pipeline**: Using Whisper for speech recognition and command translation
- **LLM-based Cognitive Planning**: Implementing intelligent decision-making for robot actions based on language commands
- **VLA Loop in Humanoid Systems**: Complete integration of vision, language, and action components
- **Capstone Overview**: Comprehensive integration of all VLA concepts

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have advanced knowledge of AI and robotics concepts and familiarity with ROS 2, OpenAI APIs, and large language models. If you need to review these fundamentals, please complete the previous modules first.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement a complete voice-to-action pipeline using Whisper
- Design LLM-based cognitive planning systems for robot action sequences
- Integrate vision, language, and action components into a working VLA system
- Apply high-level architectural reasoning to VLA system design

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on Voice-to-Action Pipeline to start your journey into vision-language-action systems for robotics.
