# Module 2: Virtual Worlds for Physical AI

Welcome to the Virtual Worlds course for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This module focuses on creating immersive simulation environments where your AI agents can learn and master humanoid robot control using Gazebo and Unity physics-based simulators.

## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Understanding gravity, collisions, joints, and humanoid dynamics in simulation environments
- **Environment & Interaction Design**: World building, obstacles, and human-robot interaction concepts
- **Sensor Simulation**: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor data flow to ROS 2

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have basic knowledge of ROS 2. If you need to review ROS 2 fundamentals, please complete Module 1 first.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure physics simulations in Gazebo
- Design complex environments with obstacles and interaction points
- Implement sensor simulation with realistic outputs
- Connect virtual sensors to ROS 2 nodes for data processing

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on Physics Simulation with Gazebo to start your journey into digital twin technology for humanoid robotics.
