# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain course for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This module focuses on advanced perception, navigation, and training using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem.

## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception (VSLAM, sensors)
- **Nav2 Integration**: Humanoid path planning and navigation

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have advanced knowledge of AI and Robotics concepts and familiarity with ROS 2. If you need to review these fundamentals, please complete Modules 1 and 2 first.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic rendering
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS packages
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid-specific navigation tasks
- Integrate AI models with ROS 2 control stacks

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on NVIDIA Isaac Sim to start your journey into advanced AI-robotics integration.
