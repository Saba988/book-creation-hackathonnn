# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This course is structured into four interconnected modules that will take you from the fundamentals of robotic middleware to advanced AI-driven humanoid robot control.

## Course Overview

This course is organized into four essential modules:

1. **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1)** - Learn about ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robot control
2. **[Module 2: Virtual Worlds for Physical AI](./digital-twin-course)** - Build immersive simulation environments where your AI agents learn to control humanoid robots in realistic physics-based worlds
3. **[Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./ai-robot-brain-isaac)** - Build intelligent robot brains using NVIDIA Isaac for perception, planning, and control
4. **[Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics](./vla-robotics)** - Explore cutting-edge VLA systems that combine computer vision, NLP, and robotic action

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts, then progress through each module sequentially to build your expertise in humanoid robotics.

Each module contains detailed explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises designed to develop your skills in creating intelligent humanoid robots.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental AI and robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

Let's begin your journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics!
