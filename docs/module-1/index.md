# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll learn about ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robot control. This module will guide you through the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture, how to bridge your Python AI knowledge to ROS controllers, and how to work with URDF files for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture including nodes, topics, and services
- Explain how ROS 2 enables communication between robot components
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Read and modify URDF files for humanoid robots
- Prepare robot models for simulation and control

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. [ROS 2 Basics](./chapter-1-ros2-basics) - Understanding the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
2. [rclpy AI Agents](./chapter-2-rclpy-ai-agents) - Bridging Python AI knowledge to ROS controllers
3. [URDF Modeling](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling) - Working with URDF files for humanoid robots

Let's begin by exploring the foundational concepts of ROS 2 architecture.
